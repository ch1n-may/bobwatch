DEVELOPER'S ORIGINAL INTENT:
"${userIntent}"

RAW CODE DIFF (Unified Format):
${rawDiff}

YOUR TASK:
Analyze this code diff against the developer's stated intent. Classify ALL code changes into exactly three categories:

1. **INTENDED** - Changes that directly fulfill the user's stated intent
2. **COLLATERAL** - Unintended but necessary side effects (refactoring, dependency updates, config changes, etc.)
3. **RISKY** - Changes that introduce security vulnerabilities, prompt injections, exposed secrets, authentication bypasses, or dangerous deviations from intent

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- MUST provide a "score" field as an integer between 1 and 100 (NEVER 0, NEVER null, NEVER undefined)
- Score calculation: 100 = perfect intent match, 90-99 = minor collateral, 70-89 = some collateral, 50-69 = significant drift, <50 = major security issues
- For RISKY items: Identify the specific threat type (see THREAT TAXONOMY below)
- For RISKY items: Generate clean, secure "remediatedCode" that fixes the vulnerability while maintaining functionality
- Be thorough but concise in explanations

🚨 **MCP INFRASTRUCTURE VULNERABILITY DETECTION (MAY 2026 FOCUS):**

**A. INSTRUCTION BOUNDARY BREACH DETECTION:**
Scan for files that allow untrusted user inputs to blend data with execution commands:
- Markdown/YAML/JSON parsers that feed directly into LLM prompts
- Dynamic command construction from user-controlled strings
- Template engines interpolating untrusted data into AI instructions
- File readers passing raw content to model contexts without sanitization
- Chat interfaces that don't separate user data from system instructions

**B. CONFUSED DEPUTY / PRIVILEGE ESCALATION DETECTION:**
Scan for AI agent privilege abuse vectors:
- Tool manifests with overly broad permissions (read/write/execute all)
- OpenAPI schemas allowing arbitrary endpoint access
- Database connectors without parameterized queries
- File system operations without path validation/allowlisting
- MCP server configurations with unrestricted tool access
- API clients with hardcoded admin tokens or elevated credentials
- Indirect prompt injections hidden in tool responses or schemas

THREAT TAXONOMY (Use these EXACT labels for threatType):
- 🚨 THREAT TYPE: MCP BOUNDARY BREACH - Instruction/data separation failure
- 🚨 THREAT TYPE: CONFUSED DEPUTY / PRIVILEGE ESCALATION - AI agent privilege hijacking
- 🚨 THREAT TYPE: PROMPT INJECTION / CRITICAL - Direct prompt manipulation
- 🚨 THREAT TYPE: SQL INJECTION - Database query vulnerability
- 🚨 THREAT TYPE: AUTH BYPASS - Authentication/authorization failure
- 🚨 THREAT TYPE: EXPOSED SECRETS - Hardcoded credentials/tokens
- 🚨 THREAT TYPE: XSS VULNERABILITY - Cross-site scripting risk
- 🚨 THREAT TYPE: RESOURCE EXHAUSTION / CRITICAL - DoS/performance degradation
- 🚨 THREAT TYPE: PATH TRAVERSAL - Unrestricted file system access
